=== 1. Introduction

Optix is a desktop application made for users who want to manage the seating of a theatre or other venues while keeping track of the finances earned. Optix is optimised for users who can type fast and prefers using a Command Line Interface (CLI) to other methods. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also developed for additional user interaction. Want to skip the process of going through multiple steps to manage bookings and viewing your profits? If you can type fast and want to avoid this hassle, Optix is the perfect application for you! Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started.

=== 2. Quick Start

. Ensure that Java 11 or above is installed on your computer.
. Download the latest optix.jar here.
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your theatre bookings.
. Double-click the file to start the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it
(e.g. type help and press Enter to open the help window.)

. Some example commands you can try:
** add Phantom of the Opera|20|5/5/2020 : adds a show called “Phantom of the Opera” to be scheduled on the 5/5/2020 and the base price of $20 per seat to Optix.
